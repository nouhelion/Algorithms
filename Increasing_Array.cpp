//You are given an array of n integers. You want to modify the array so that it is increasing, i.e.,
//every element is at least as large as the previous element.
//On each move, you may increase the value of any element by one.
//What is the minimum number of moves required?
//Input
//The first input line contains an integer n: the size of the array.
//Then, the second line contains n integers x1,x2,â€¦,xn: the contents of the array.
//Output
//Print the minimum number of moves.
//Input:
//5
//3 2 5 1 7
//Output:
//5
